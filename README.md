**DynamicKeepInv** is a sophisticated plugin that revolutionizes how the keepInventory gamerule works on Minecraft servers. Instead of a simple global toggle, it dynamically controls inventory loss based on in-game time, death causes, territory protection, and economy.

It is designed for modern servers (1.20.4+) and features full native support for **Folia** region threading.

## Why use DynamicKeepInv?

Vanilla Minecraft forces server administrators to choose between "Too Easy" (keepInventory true) or "Too Hard" (keepInventory false).

**DynamicKeepInv** bridges this gap by offering a configurable balance:
* **Day/Night Cycle:** Players feel safe during the day but must survive the night without protection.
* **PvP vs PvE:** Make PvP high-stakes (drop items) while keeping PvE casual (keep items), or vice-versa.
* **Economy Sink:** Allow players to pay a fee to save their items upon death via an interactive GUI.
* **Land Integration:** Respects claims from Lands and GriefPrevention (e.g., keep items in your own base).

## Key Features

### Time-Based Rules
* Automatically enables keepInventory during the day.
* Disables it at night based on configurable start and end ticks.
* Plays sounds and sends titles when the status changes.

### Advanced Death Rules
* **PvP vs PvE:** Configure separate rules for Item Loss and XP Loss based on the killer.
* **By World:** Set different rules for the Overworld, Nether, and End.
* **Permission Bypass:** Players with `dynamickeepinv.bypass` never lose items.

### Economy & Death GUI
* **Death Confirmation GUI:** When a player dies, a GUI appears asking them to **PAY** to keep items or **DROP** them.
* **Auto-Pay:** Players can toggle `/dki autopay` to automatically deduct the fee and skip the GUI.
* **Persistence:** If a player disconnects while dead, their pending death is saved to a database and the GUI reopens upon rejoin.
* *(Requires Vault)*

### Player Statistics
* Tracks death history for every player.
* **In-Game GUI:** Run `/dki stats` to view:
    * Total Deaths, Saved Deaths, and Lost Deaths.
    * Money spent on keeping inventory.
    * Death cause breakdown (Day, Night, PvP, etc.).
* **PlaceholderAPI:** Display these stats on scoreboards or chat.

### Plugin Integrations
* **Lands:** Configure rules for "Own Land", "Enemy Land", and "Wilderness".
* **GriefPrevention:** Similar support for claims.
* **GravesX / AxGraves:** If a player chooses to drop items (or cannot afford to pay), they are placed into a Grave instead of scattering on the ground.
* **Folia:** 100% thread-safe region scheduling.

## Logic Hierarchy

When a player dies, the plugin decides whether to keep or drop items based on this priority order (highest to lowest):

1.  **Bypass Permission** (`dynamickeepinv.bypass`)
    * *If player has this permission, they always keep items.*
2.  **Claim Protection** (Lands / GriefPrevention)
    * *Is the player in their own claim? Use claim settings.*
3.  **Death Cause** (PvP / PvE)
    * *Did another player kill them? Use PvP settings.*
4.  **Wilderness Settings**
    * *If enabled, use specific settings for unclaimed land.*
5.  **Time-Based** (Day / Night)
    * *Fallback: Is it currently Day or Night?*
