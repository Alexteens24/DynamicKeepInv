## Database

Stats are stored in a SQLite database:

```
plugins/DynamicKeepInv/stats.db
```

### Database Structure

**player_stats table:**
- UUID, player name
- Deaths saved/lost/total
- Last death info
- Economy totals

**death_reasons table:**
- Per-reason saved/lost counts

### Backup

Simply copy `stats.db` to backup player statistics.

### Reset Player Stats

Currently no in-game command. To reset:
1. Stop server
2. Delete `stats.db` (resets all) or edit with SQLite tool
3. Start server

## Notes

- Stats are also used by the first-death rule. If stats are disabled, first-death leniency is skipped.
- Death streak tracking is in-memory and resets on server restart. It is not stored in `stats.db`.

---

## Disable Stats

If you don't want stats tracking:

```yaml
stats:
  enabled: false
```

This will:
- Disable stats GUI (`/dki stats` will show error)
- Stop recording deaths
- Disable stats placeholders
